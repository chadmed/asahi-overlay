Webcam support has finally been merged into the Asahi kernel! All users of
machines equipped with a webcam can begin enjoying this functionality by upgrading
to asahi-sources-6.5.0_p11.

IMPORTANT: If your install predates 21 August 2023, some additional work will be required
for you to get the maximum possible quality out of your webcam. To retrieve the calibration
blobs for your machine, please follow these steps after updating your @world set:

1.  Boot into macOS
2.  Mount your ESP to /Volumes/EFI
3.  cp /usr/sbin/appleh13camerad /Volumes/EFI/
4.  Reboot into Linux and mount the ESP to /boot/efi/
5.  mkdir /tmp/firmware
6.  cd /tmp/firmware
7.  mv /boot/efi/appleh13camerad .
8.  sudo tar xzf /boot/efi/asahi/all_firmware.tar.gz
9.  sudo tar czf /boot/efi/asahi/all_firmware.tar.gz .
10. sudo asahi-fwupdate

You should now be able to enjoy your webcam at full quality. Note that your webcam will still work
even without completing these steps, however it will produce a much lower quality image.
