Good news everyone! Upstreaming efforts have now begun in earnest! Starting
with easy packages like tiny-dfr and the asahi-nvram suite, we hope to get even more
packages out of this overlay and into ::gentoo in the coming months. The
current focus is to get Apple Silicon-friendly install media up and running.
This will take the form of a Gentoo-flavoured Asahi Installer, as well as a
bootable LiveCD image for more adventurous users.

User Action Required:
    The asahi-nvram-meta package has been deprecated as it was deemed to be
    superfluous and unable to be upstreamed. Please add the set of
    asahi-nvram packages you use to @world. The asahi-nvram-meta package
    will be dropped from the overlay on or after February 9, 2024.

We have also set up an Official(tm) Gentoo project to better facilitate
integration efforts and provide representation on official Gentoo infrastructure.
